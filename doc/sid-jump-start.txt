* The super minimal SID manual
This manual has taken information on wikipedia and from this html page
which reproduce the original datasheet[fn:1].

For better performance, it is suggested to use an arduino uno as a
I2C-connected SID emulator.

** Let's Start
/The 6581 Sound Interface Device (SID) is a single-chip, 8-bit  3-voice electronic music synthesizer/sound effects generator compatible with the 65XX and similar microprocessor families/

The SID has been part of the C/64 success.

This arduino emulation library divert Voice2 to another pin, to enable a
"Stero" effect somewhat.

Connect pin9 and pin 10 to two piezo speaker, and the other side to
the ground.

The suggested setup is to have an arduino as a SID, driven via
I2C. The I2C protocol is a 16bit simple protocol: register, value.

The 6581 consists of three synthesizer “voices” which can be used
independently or in conjunction to create complex sounds. 
Each voice consists of a Tone Oscillator/Waveform Generator, an
Envelope Generator and an Amplitude Modulator.
The Envelope Generator is controlled via an ADSR (Attack Decay Sustain
Release)  configuration.
