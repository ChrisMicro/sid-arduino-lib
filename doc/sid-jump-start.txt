* The super minimal SID manual
This manual has taken information on wikipedia and from this html page
which reproduce the original datasheet[fn:1].

For better performance, it is suggested to use an arduino uno as a
I2C-connected SID emulator.

** Let's Start
/The 6581 Sound Interface Device (SID) is a single-chip,  3-voice electronic music synthesizer/sound effects generator compatible with the 65XX and similar microprocessor families/

The [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_SID][SID]] has been part of the C/64 success.

This arduino emulation library divert Voice2 to another pin, to enable a
"Stero" effect somewhat.
Connect pin9 and pin 10 to two piezo speaker, and the other side to
the ground.

The 6581 consists of three synthesizer “voices” which can be used
independently or in conjunction to create complex sounds. 
Each voice consists of a Tone Oscillator/Waveform Generator, an
Envelope Generator and an Amplitude Modulator.
The Envelope Generator is controlled via an ADSR (Attack Decay Sustain
Release)  configuration.

When a mechanical musical instrument produces sound, the Loudness of
the sound produced changes over time in a way that varies from
instrument to instrument. When a pipe organ's key is pressed, for
example, it plays a note at constant volume; the sound dies quickly
when the key is released. 
By contrast, the sound of a guitar is
loudest immediately after a string is plucked, and quickly fades. 

A synthesizer's ADSR envelope is a way to tailor the timbre for the
synth, sometimes to make it sound more like a mechanical instrument. 
A quick attack with little decay helps it sound more like an organ; a
longer decay and zero sustain makes it sound more like a guitar. While
envelopes are most often applied to volume, they are also commonly
used to control other sound elements, such as filter frequencies or
oscillator pitches.

Today modern synthesizers use samples to reproduce sound with a strong
accuracy. 
But in  1982, ADSR was a state-of-the-art for a music chip.

/The suggested setup is to have an arduino as a SID, driven via I2C (see examples)/ 
The I2C protocol in the example is very easy: send two bytes, one for
the reguster and the second fo the value to store inside.
